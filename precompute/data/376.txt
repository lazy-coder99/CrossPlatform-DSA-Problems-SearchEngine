You are given a0-indexedinteger arraynumscontainingndistinct positive integers. A permutation ofnumsis called special if:

For all indexes0 <= i < n - 1, eithernums[i] % nums[i+1] == 0ornums[i+1] % nums[i] == 0.

Returnthe total number of special permutations.As the answer could be large, return itmodulo109+ 7.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,3,6]
Output: 2
Explanation: [3,6,2] and [2,6,3] are the two special permutations of nums.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,4,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: [3,1,4] and [4,1,3] are the two special permutations of nums.


Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 14
1 <= nums[i] <= 109
